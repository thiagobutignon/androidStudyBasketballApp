# androidStudyBasketballApp
Hello, this is my first app i created during my study in the Nanodegree Udacity - Android Basics. 
I implemented a Relative Layout and Linear Layout to build this layout.
For the buttons i optimizate a little to have less code and to be more easy for other people read this.

I hope you enjoy it!
